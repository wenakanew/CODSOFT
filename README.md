# CODSOFT Internship Projects

Welcome to the repository for the projects I completed during my Python internship at CODSOFT.


## Introduction
This repository contains various projects I worked on as a Python intern at CODSOFT. Each project showcases different aspects of Python programming and problem-solving skills.

## PROJECT 1

# **Simple GUI Calculator using Tkinter**  

## **Overview**  
This is a simple GUI-based calculator built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through an interactive interface.  

## **Features**  
- User-friendly interface with a clean layout.  
- Supports basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).  
- Displays input and results dynamically.  
- Includes a "Clear" button to reset calculations.  
- Exit button to close the application.  

## **Requirements**  
- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter (built-in with Python)  

## **How to Run**  
1. Ensure you have Python installed.  
2. Save the script as `calculator.py`.  
3. Run the script using:  
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
4. The calculator GUI will launch, allowing you to perform calculations.
